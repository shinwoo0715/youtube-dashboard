ValueError: Invalid property specified for object of type plotly.graph_objs.layout.Legend: 'labels' Did you mean "title"? Valid properties: bgcolor Sets the legend background color. Defaults to `layout.paper_bgcolor`. bordercolor Sets the color of the border enclosing the legend. borderwidth Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the legend. entrywidth Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend. Use 0 to size the entry based on the text width, when `entrywidthmode` is set to "pixels". entrywidthmode Determines what entrywidth means. font Sets the font used to text the legend items. groupclick Determines the behavior on legend group item click. "toggleitem" toggles the visibility of the individual item clicked on the graph. "togglegroup" toggles the visibility of all items in the same legendgroup as the item clicked on the graph. grouptitlefont Sets the font for group titles in legend. Defaults to `legend.font` with its size increased about 10%. indentation Sets the indentation (in px) of the legend entries. itemclick Determines the behavior on legend item click. "toggle" toggles the visibility of the item clicked on the graph. "toggleothers" makes the clicked item the sole visible item on the graph. False disables legend item click interactions. itemdoubleclick Determines the behavior on legend item double-click. "toggle" toggles the visibility of the item clicked on the graph. "toggleothers" makes the clicked item the sole visible item on the graph. False disables legend item double-click interactions. itemsizing Determines if the legend items symbols scale with their corresponding "trace" attributes or remain "constant" independent of the symbol size on the graph. itemwidth Sets the width (in px) of the legend item symbols (the part other than the title.text). orientation Sets the orientation of the legend. title :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.legend.Title` instance or dict with compatible properties tracegroupgap Sets the amount of vertical space (in px) between legend groups. traceorder Determines the order at which the legend items are displayed. If "normal", the items are displayed top-to- bottom in the same order as the input data. If "reversed", the items are displayed in the opposite order as "normal". If "grouped", the items are displayed in groups (when a trace `legendgroup` is provided). if "grouped+reversed", the items are displayed in the opposite order as "grouped". uirevision Controls persistence of legend-driven changes in trace and pie label visibility. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. valign Sets the vertical alignment of the symbols with respect to their associated text. visible Determines whether or not this legend is visible. x Sets the x position with respect to `xref` (in normalized coordinates) of the legend. When `xref` is "paper", defaults to 1.02 for vertical legends and defaults to 0 for horizontal legends. When `xref` is "container", defaults to 1 for vertical legends and defaults to 0 for horizontal legends. Must be between 0 and 1 if `xref` is "container". and between "-2" and 3 if `xref` is "paper". xanchor Sets the legend's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the `x` position to the "left", "center" or "right" of the legend. Value "auto" anchors legends to the right for `x` values greater than or equal to 2/3, anchors legends to the left for `x` values less than or equal to 1/3 and anchors legends with respect to their center otherwise. xref Sets the container `x` refers to. "container" spans the entire `width` of the plot. "paper" refers to the width of the plotting area only. y Sets the y position with respect to `yref` (in normalized coordinates) of the legend. When `yref` is "paper", defaults to 1 for vertical legends, defaults to "-0.1" for horizontal legends on graphs w/o range sliders and defaults to 1.1 for horizontal legends on graph with one or multiple range sliders. When `yref` is "container", defaults to 1. Must be between 0 and 1 if `yref` is "container" and between "-2" and 3 if `yref` is "paper". yanchor Sets the legend's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the `y` position to the "top", "middle" or "bottom" of the legend. Value "auto" anchors legends at their bottom for `y` values less than or equal to 1/3, anchors legends to at their top for `y` values greater than or equal to 2/3 and anchors legends with respect to their middle otherwise. yref Sets the container `y` refers to. "container" spans the entire `height` of the plot. "paper" refers to the height of the plotting area only. Did you mean "title"? Bad property path: labels ^^^^^^
